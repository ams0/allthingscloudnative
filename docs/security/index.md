## Introduction

Kubernetes security is essential to maintaining a secure and reliable cluster environment. This document covers important security mechanisms such as RBAC, Pod security, network policies, and secrets management that you should consider when deploying Kubernetes in production environments.

## Auditing and Monitoring

Implementing an auditing and monitoring solution helps in tracking events and identifying suspicious activities. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Falco can be used for real-time monitoring of your Kubernetes cluster.

- **Enable audit logging**: Capture detailed events occurring within your cluster.
- **Monitor logs**: Regularly inspect logs to identify potential security incidents.
- **Alerting**: Configure alerts to notify your team of critical events.

## Best Practices

- **Run containers as non-root**: Always configure your containers to run as a non-root user to limit privileges.
- **Enable RBAC**: Use Role-Based Access Control to define granular access to Kubernetes resources.
- **Use network policies**: Restrict pod-to-pod communication using Network Policies to reduce the attack surface.
- **Encrypt Secrets**: Ensure that Kubernetes Secrets are encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Regular updates**: Keep your Kubernetes and container runtime up to date with the latest security patches.
- **Monitor your cluster**: Implement tools like Falco, Prometheus, and Grafana to continuously monitor your cluster.
